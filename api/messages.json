    "Hello Clubbers, We're running down to the last couple of weeks of Glee Club! Including this week, we have four more meetings.... I can't believe how quickly time has gone by. But we've still got lots of work to do and many things to accomplish, and I'm so looking forward to these upcoming weeks that we've got left. I would like to invite you all to join in on our weekly Executive Board meeting! Our meeting will be held this Thursday, 03/20 from 6:00-6:55 PM in MLB B137. For those who are unfamiliar, Exec meetings are a great way to learn more about the behind the scenes on how Club works; please read the FAQs below to learn more about these meetings: Exec Meeting FAQs Who can attend exec meetings? Anyone can (and should!) attend exec meetings! Attendance is not mandatory though unless you are a member of the executive board. Anyone is also free to submit an agenda item. What is an agenda item? An agenda item sounds really fancy, but it's just something you want to talk about. It can be an idea for a new event, a proposal for using social dues, a short brainstorming session, etc. There will also be 10 minutes at the end of every executive board meeting dedicated to open questions/concerns. How do I submit an agenda item? Anyone can submit an agenda item! To submit an agenda item, all you have to do is reply to this email (don't reply all) with a brief description of what you want to talk about and how long you think a discussion will take (usually between 5-15 minutes). The last ten minutes of every meeting will be dedicated to questions from the Club at large, so that is another opportunity to bring up something that is not long enough for a whole agenda item. How do I join the Executive Board? We just held interviews to appoint new members of the Executive Board and Junior Managers for the year! Later in the Sprint (March 23rd) Club will hold elections for our President, Vice-President, and Parliamentarian.

    "Gentlemen, The Hill Concert was a complete success! Not only the singing but the shenanigans afterwards were truly incredible so I want to thank each and every one of youüôè. Here is a highlight from the haulüëÄ: Haul.jpg Now that Hill is over though, it's time FOR THE FRIARS CONCERTTTT!!!!!!!!!! As a proud member of your favorite acapella group I'd like to formally invite you all to our concert this Friday, April 18th at Rackham Auditorium! You can get tickets here, but if you're a current clubber don't buy them online because you get $5 tickets at the door! Friars concert of course means: FRIARS PRE-GAME, MID-GAME AND POST GAME!!!!!! Pre-game (Clubbers only): Head on over to the Igloo (418 N State St) at 6:30pm to adequately prepare for the wonderful concert you are about to witness. Mid-game (Clubbers only): During intermission run back to the Igloo for some stuff-filled Jell-O treats to make the second half of the concert even more enjoyableüòÅ Post-game(Anyone!): The Igloo and The Friars present: THE FRINECRAFT PARTY. Show up, show out and invite your friends to the afterpartyüòé. Feel free to share the attached graphic around (shoutout Michael V again for another insane poster). I hate to do this, with Hill being so recent, but with stuff related events we will need Things 4 Stuff!!! Venmo @Jack-Kernan if you have anything to spare after last week! Let's make this final party one to remember!",
    "Gentlemen, Glee week is moving right along and the festivities continue! Last night the Igloo hosted yet another stuff pong tournament for the history books. The alumni relations duo of Nathan Shatz and Nik Walling dubbed '2 Massive Pongs' faced many on their way to the finals. With convincing victories against Brothers in Pong (Tim Nagel and Seth Amoguis) and Azzurro (Brad O'Brien and Yingnan Yan) they established themselves as a threat. One more dominant victory against CumCo (Jon Faydenko and Neal Dwivedula) sealed their spot in the final game. Their games weren't flashy, but they were consistent! Team Connor O'Ryan (Connor Casey and Ryan O'Shaughnessy) has history! The past three semesters they've fallen short with two tragic second place finishes (One of them against yours trulyüòÅ) and a measly quarter-finals finish last semester. This semester they came with something to prove and it showed! After an easy win against Gluff Glong (Andrew Reno and Dylan Maldonado), they fought cup for cup with 2 Friars 1 Cup (Jonah Schloerb and Ben DeVries) finishing the nail biter with a devastating same cup to crush their dreams. In the semi's they faced reigning champs 'Adi's Toilet is NOT Clogged' (Erik Hanson and Adi Bapat) and started off hot. The champs did not go down without a fight however, and brought them down to 1 cup left. In ANOTHER same cup finish, team Connor O'Ryan didn't even leave a chance at redemption for the enemy team, securing their spot in the finals.With everything on the line, a dominant performance by 2 Massive Pongs and absolute CINEMA from Connor O'Ryan, there was one last game to decide it all. Yet contrary to expectation, in a complete SNOOZE-FEST, the worst pong playing unfolded before our eyes. Missed shot after missed shot, with Connor O'Ryan catching cups occasionally. After YEARS, down 6 cups to 1 cup, 2 Massive Pongs tried their hardest but could not mount the comeback, crowning Connor O'Ryan as the winner! While it wasn't pretty, team Connor O'Ryan FINALLY got their first championship and put the washed allegations to rest. Congrats to our Winter 2025 Glee Club Pong Tournament Champions, Connor Casey and Ryan O'Shaughnessy!!!!!"
